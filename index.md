## Recent Work

The properties of the young pulsars and their relations to the supernova remnants (SNRs) have been the interesting topics.
Here, we employ the statistical tests on the two groups of young radio pulsars with (52) and  without (630) SNRs to reveal if they share different origins.
K-S and M-W-W tests indicate that the two samples have the different distributions, and the cumulative number ratio between the pulsars with (SNR-PSR) and without SNRs (non SNR-PSR) at the different spindown ages decreases significantly after 10-20 Kyr.
Thus, **we propose that there are two types of young radio pulsars that are produced by two types of supernovae (SNe)**, corresponding to their SNR lifetimes, which can be roughly ascribed to the low-energy and high-energy SNe.
